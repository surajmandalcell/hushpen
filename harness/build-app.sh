# usage: [HUSHPEN_BUILD_RELEASE=1] build-app.sh
# HUSHPEN_BUILD_RELEASE=1 also builds the release app (no hook, no update-test-feed) and copies it to
# harness-bin/hushpen-release, for the updates suite check that a shipped build ignores the feed override.
# HUSHPEN_BUILD_HOOKREL=1 also builds an optimized app that keeps the test hook (release profile
# with debug assertions on, which the hook's compile guard allows) as harness-bin/hushpen-hookrel,
# for packaging/smoke/start-latency.sh. It is never shipped and it replaces target/release/hushpen.
# Builds the debug app (features test-automation and update-test-feed; the debug app is never shipped), hookctl, and the hushpen-llm and hushpen-tts workers for the harness platform (linux/arm64 unless HUSHPEN_PLATFORM says otherwise) in the hushpen-build
# container and copies them to $HUSHPEN_ROOT/harness-bin, the folder every slot mounts as /app.
# The repo mounts read-only. Heavy (4 CPUs): counts as 2 busy slots.
