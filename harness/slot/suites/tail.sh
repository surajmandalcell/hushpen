# Capture tail checks: a clip that ends on speech, with no trailing silence, is played into the
# virtual microphone and the recording is stopped the moment the player returns. The last word
# must be in the transcript. Busy: it transcribes with base-q5_1. It empties /data and restarts the
# app, so the slot must not be shared. Runs in one slot through with-env.sh.
