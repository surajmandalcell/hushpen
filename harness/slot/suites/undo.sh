# Undo cleanup: VAL-UNDO-001 to 007 and VAL-CROSS-002. Part one runs against the stub endpoint
# (harness/slot/openai-stub.py on 127.0.0.1:11434): its default answer is the transcript with
# " [stub]" added, so the AI text always differs from the rule text and no model is needed. Part
# two (VAL-CROSS-002) uses the local Qwen3.5 2B model from the fixture folder, a dictionary
# replacement, and the self-correction fixture. The words come from the virtual microphone and
# the hold key's path goes through the hook (pipeline-event), so a keyboard grab cannot stop it.
# The GTK target (target-gtk.py) steps back on Ctrl+Z like an editor's entry, keeps the live text
# in /out/gtk-live.txt and one line for every Ctrl+Z in /out/gtk-undo.log. The xterm target is
# stock xterm running `cat > /out/xterm.txt`; a Ctrl+Z that reached its terminal would stop cat.
# Needs filler-dictation.wav and ai-self-correction.wav in HUSHPEN_TEST_FIXTURES (mounted at
# /fixtures), the llm folder there, and the base model in /assets. Start the slot with
# VAL_CPUS=4 VAL_MEM=4g (the local model counts as 2 busy slots). It empties /data, so the slot
# must not be shared.
