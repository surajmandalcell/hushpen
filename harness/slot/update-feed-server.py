"""A local update feed for the updates suite.

usage: update-feed-server.py <log.jsonl> [port]

Listens on 127.0.0.1 (8765 by default). The first line of /tmp/feed-mode names the folder under
/harness/slot/update-feed that the server answers from (newer, same, tampered, wrongkey), read on
every request; the mode "404" answers every request with 404 and "slow" waits 30 s first.
/latest.json and /latest.json.minisig come from that folder. Any other path, for example an
installer file, is served as 404 and still logged, so the suite can prove that nothing else was
asked for. Every request is one line in the log: time, method, path, and every request header.
The folders hold signed copies of test manifests: the secret keys were thrown away after signing,
so the files are fixed. `same` (2.0.0-dev) is not newer than the debug app; `newer` is 2.1.0, above 2.1.0-dev;
`wrongkey` is signed by a key that test.pub does not match; `tampered` changed after signing.
The self-update suite adds /update-test (harness/update-fixtures.sh): a mode may also name a folder
under /update-test/feed (good, badsha), and a path that names a file in /update-test/rc2 is served
from there, in 64 KiB steps 50 ms apart while /tmp/feed-slow exists. Without /update-test every
other path is still a 404.
