//! The dictation pipeline as a pure reducer.
//!
//! Every surface (hotkey, Home, tray, flow bar) turns its input into an [`AppEvent`] and calls
//! [`DictationMachine::handle`]. The machine owns no clock, thread, or file: time comes in as
//! the `now` argument (milliseconds on any monotonic scale), and every action comes out as an
//! [`Effect`] for the app to run. Slow effects report back as events that carry the session id
//! of the run that asked for them, so a late answer from a cancelled run changes nothing.
//!
//! A start never waits for the session before it. While that session transcribes, cleans, or
//! inserts, it finishes behind the new one: it still inserts its text and saves its row, and
//! texts go in the order they were spoken. Esc and the flow bar follow the newest session.
//! When it ends, the newest older session that still runs comes back to the front.
